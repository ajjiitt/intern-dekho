    "description": "About the job\n        \n\n\n        \n                  What is Sprinto?Sprinto is an early stage SaaS startup, working in the information security \"compliance\" space. This is a flourishing area, but has not seen any innovation in the last couple of decades. Thanks to some macro-changes, we think the space is ripe for a startup to become a market leader. Our job as founders and early team members is to ensure that Sprinto has a shot at this opportunity.\nWhy work with us?- Sprinto has an experienced founding team. Prior to Sprinto, we (Girish and Raghu) built Recruiterbox.com. We bootstrapped recruiterbox from 2011 to 2017, and scaled it to 2500+ global customers and a team of ~45 people spread across India and US. At the end of 2017, Recruiterbox was acquired by Turn/River capital.- We wrote most of the early code at Recruiterbox, and remained among the top 5 committers even when the company ran at scale. We are engineers at heart and love building scalable systems for people to coordinate, work together and build great things together- Sprinto is well capitalised from top notch investors like Accel, Elevation & Blume. While you have all the advantages of working on challenging problems that come with working in a startup, you also don't have the risk of the company running out of money.- Last but not the least, stock options. While all early stage startups offer stock options, not all of them are same. At Sprinto, we aren't satisfied with being just a large/successful company. We want to be the category leader. On a good outcome, your stint with Sprinto will leave you with no need to work for money and you only continue to work for passion.\nRoles and Responsibilities- Collaboarte with relevant Stake-Holders- Work across teams to such as Marketing, Sales, Customer Experience and Engineering to ensure everything is kept track off and the ball isnt dropped off- Work on the Product Roadmap & Lifecycle- Help the product team prioritise the features and tasks and give valuable feedback based on various stakeholder conversations- Help the product and engineering teams to flesh out features and ensure there are no blockers on delivery- Work with Product Managers by using data to understand customer behaviour and performance of features; be data-driven in estimating size of impact and determining prioritisation.\nWhat we are looking for?- A Fresher or Currently pursuing a Bachelor's or Master's Degree in Computer Science or business studies from Tier I & Tier II colleges are preferred.- Excellent communication, analytical, logical thinking, problem-solving, and writing skills.- Understanding and/or hands-on experience in software development is preferred.- Data-driven. Strong ability in analyzing data to derive insights and make decisions.- Adaptable, open-minded, and comfortable to work with ambiguity and change in the fast paced SAAS industry.- This can turn into a full time offer after a 6 month internship.",
